Different languages force a programmer to think about computation in a different way. For example, in Racket everything is an expression, or in Python everything is an object. C also forces programmer to think in a particular way about computation. What differ between C and most other languages is that the computational model C confines programmers in is one that matches reality (i.e., the hardware the program is executed on). 

C was designed at a time when security wasn't on the mind of many. As a result, various software vulnerabilities can manifest in C programs where they are not possible in others. However, the errors that can manifest in C programs are solely due to the C programmers' oversight. In other languages with a computational model differing from the underlying machine, errors can manifest in the implementation of the computational model abstraction. For example, although Java frees programmers from pointers errors (e.g., null pointer dereference, double free), the JVM itself itself riddled with pointer errors.
