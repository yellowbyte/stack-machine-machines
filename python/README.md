In Python, everything is an object. And this simple idea enables programmers with powerful computational power: specfically, metaprogramming. Because everything is an object, this means that classes and functions are also objects. And like other objects, they can be modified.  

Conventional wisdom says that interpreted language such as Python suffers from speed since the code doesn't execute directly by the underlying CPU. Fortunately, JIT optimization ideas like [inline caching](https://mobile.twitter.com/raymondh/status/1357478486647005187) have significantly speed up the language. Furthermore, runtime idea such as lazy evaluation (e.g., generator) is obvious to implement in compiled language like C.
