C++ is comparable to C with battery-included, where the battery are abstractions (e.g., object-oriented programming) and libraries (e.g., std::vector). Although not implying C doesn't come with libraries (it does), the libraries C comes with is pale in comparison to the libraries C++ comes with. Aside from having more feature-rich libraries, C++ also offer programmers object-oriented functionalities. Often times C++ is called "C with batteries." More features/libraries do not always translate to better languages though. Interesting aside, [the walrus operator introduced in Python 3.8 was one of the reasons that made Guido van Rossum step down as head of Python](https://pythonsimplified.com/the-most-controversial-python-walrus-operator/). Likewise, the introduction of the more feature-rich C++ do not spell doom for C. There are programmers that still prefer C over C++ and for good reasons.
