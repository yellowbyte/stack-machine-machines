Programming in assembly, or the language that the machine speaks, can be mind-opening in many ways. To me, one such mind-opening concept is for-loop, while-loop, or even recursion (with tail-recursive optimization) essentially boil down to the same underlying instructions: an if-statement where one of the branches jumps backward. That's it.

Another important concept programming in assembly reinforces is the importance of the memory hierarchy. Registers are few, yet all computation has to be done through them. Although higher-level languages free programmers from directly dealing with registers, they also may not be making the most optimal choice. In fact, register allocation takes up a significant chunk of the compilation process, and the problem itself is NP-Complete.
