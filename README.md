# stack-machine-machines

This repository contains implementations of a stack-based compiler in different programming languages. A stack-based compiler performs a single-pass through the source code and generates code as it sees it with a stack data structure. The stack is the primary data structure in a stack-based compiler and therefore its current state state represents the current state of computation. A stack-based compiler is elegant and easy-to-reason, but does not generate optimized code because it generates code "right as it sees it." However, because of its elegance, I figure it would be a good medium for me to explore different programming languages, different paradigms, and the different language featuers that are enabled by those paradigms.
