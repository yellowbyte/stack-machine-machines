In Python, everything is an object. And this seemly OOP idea also enables programmers with powerful computational power: metaprogramming. Because everything is an object, this means that classes and functions are also objects. And like other objects, they can be modified programmatically at runtime.  

Conventional wisdom says that interpreted language such as Python suffers from speed since the code doesn't execute directly by the underlying CPU. Fortunately, JIT optimization ideas like [inline caching](https://mobile.twitter.com/raymondh/status/1357478486647005187) have significantly speed up the language. Furthermore, runtime idea such as lazy evaluation (e.g., generator) is built into the language whereas it is not obvious to implement in compiled language like C.
